    <h1>Down Bad</h1>
    <p>Taylor Swift</p>
   <ul>
    [Verse 1]
    <p>Did you really beam me up
        In a cloud of sparkling dust
        <br>
        Just to do experiments on?
        Tell me I was the chosen one
        <br>
        Showed me that this world is bigger than us
        <br>
        Then sent me back where I came from</p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
        <br>
        Everything comes out teenage 
        <br>
        petulance
        <br>
        "Fxxx it if I can't have him"
        <br>
        "I might just die, it would make no difference"
        <br>
        Down bad, wakin' up in blood
        <br>
        Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
        <br>
        Fxxx it if I can't have us
        <br>
        I might just not get up, I might stay</p>
   </ul>
