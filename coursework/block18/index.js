// A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
// A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
// Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
// ...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the code should behave:
// What should happen with unexpected inputs?
// What kinds of unexpected inputs should we worry about?
// What should happen when there are multiples of the same odd number in the arrays? (Hint: We gave you the answer to this one in the example above.)

// A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:
// What should happen if the cart is empty?
// What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
// What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
// Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!
